**THE PROCEDURAL GENERATION!**

im lying, I want to add tile collision first

after a LOT of time, Im backing to make this project
- Added a animation to the flowers on the ground (alpha and made in the laziest way possible)
- Trees don't spawn inside of anothers (scrapping the assets that I made of one tree in front of another)
- FINNALY THE TILE COLLISION IS BEING ADDED!!!!! (it only collides by sides, and its VERY buggy, don't use it :))

I will fix the tile collision someday (the check is happening on the draw function, 'cause im stupid)
