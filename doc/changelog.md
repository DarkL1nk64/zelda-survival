**THE PROCEDURAL GENERATION!**

im lying, I want to add the tile collision first

## 05/22/2025

More broken than (my) sleep 0.0.4

after a LOT of time, Im backing to make this project
- Added a animation to the flowers on the ground (alpha and made in the laziest way possible)
- Trees don't spawn inside of anothers (scrapping the assets that I made of one tree in front of another)
- FINNALY THE TILE COLLISION IS BEING ADDED!!!!! (it only collides in the X coordinate, and its VERY buggy, don't use it :))

I will fix the tile collision someday (the check is happening on the draw function, 'cause im stupid)

## 05/23/2025

The best overall! 0.0.5

- TILE COLLISION NOW WORKS PROPERLY!!!!!!!!
- Now you can place blocks on the ground (only a hole, 'cause the dungeon walls are on the dungeon tileset)
- I started to make a thing that the player will appear behind certain objects depending of its position
- It now have a list that contains special tiles, that have properties that other tiles don't
- Trying to make a way to export and import maps to the game

**maybe** i gonna make somethings more, and THEN after that I will finally make
**THE PROCEDURAL GENERATION!**

## 05/24/2025

yeah, instead of do my homework, i decided to make other changes

- Now I fixed the collision, so now, Link collides with objects outside of the screen, so you won't enter inside a bush and get stuck
when you pass from a screen to another
- The web tab now haves a icon!
- That thing of link appear behind of certain objects depending of his position was scrapped (the original game doesn't have that)

Now is the time, that EVERYONE was waiting

**dramatic drums**
**dramatic pause**

**THE F*CKING PROCEDURAL GENERATION!!!!!!**

yey

keep note that now, we aren't in the version 0.0.5,

## 05/29/2025

Infinite Infinity 0.1.0 - My first game that isn't in the 0.0.x version!

After a time, Im backing to code this game
nothing that I added was related with **THE F*CKING PROCEDURAL GENERATION!!!!!!**
'cause I forgot
- Added mobile controls (VERY ugly and its just a placeholder until I get a GBC sprite)
- Added a hud with the selected items in each button
- Added rupee counter! *kaching!*

## 05/30/2025

Mobile exists...:(

- Now the controls aren't specific keyboard keys anymore, they are a object with the controls names

- Added health counter (broken)

## 06/05/2025

Happy new month!

NOW!:
