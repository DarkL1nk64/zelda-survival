**THE PROCEDURAL GENERATION!**

im lying, I want to add the tile collision first

## 05/22/2025

after a LOT of time, Im backing to make this project
- Added a animation to the flowers on the ground (alpha and made in the laziest way possible)
- Trees don't spawn inside of anothers (scrapping the assets that I made of one tree in front of another)
- FINNALY THE TILE COLLISION IS BEING ADDED!!!!! (it only collides in the X coordinate, and its VERY buggy, don't use it :))

I will fix the tile collision someday (the check is happening on the draw function, 'cause im stupid)

## 05/23/2025

- TILE COLLISION NOW WORKS PROPERLY!!!!!!!!
- Now you can place blocks on the ground (only a hole, 'cause the dungeon walls are on the dungeon tileset)
- I started to make a thing that the player will appear behind certain objects depending of its position
- It now have a list that contains special tiles, that have properties that other tiles don't
- Trying to make a way to export and import maps to the game

**maybe** i gonna make somethings more, and after that I will finally make
**THE PROCEDURAL GENERATION!**

## 05/24/2025

yeah, instead of do my homework, i decided to make other changes

- Now I fixed the collision, so now, Link collides with objects outside of the screen, so you won't enter inside a bush and get stuck
when you pass from a screen to another
- The web tab now haves a icon!
- That thing of link appear behind of certain objects depending of his position was scrapped (the original game doesn't have that)

Now is the time, that EVERYONE was waiting

## 05/29/2025

After a time, Im backing to code this game
nothing that I added was related with **THE F*CKING PROCEDURAL GENERATION!!!!!!**
'cause I forgot

- Added a hud with the selected items in each button
- Added rupee counter! *kaching!*

## 05/30/2025

Mobile exists...:(

- Added health counter (broken)

## 06/05/2025

Happy new month!

- Mobile controls were removed

Now, I will finally make **THE F*CKING PROCEDURAL GENERATION!!!!!!**

And the coding starts...
NOW!:
