# The Legend of Zelda: Survival
![NotActualGameFootageLMAO](assets/titlescreen.png)

this name can change later, but in a shorter way:
Zelda Survival is a survival game, using the The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening sprites (because they are amazing)

**UPDATE!:** the game's name now is *The Legend of Zelda: a Link's Survival*...yeah, very creative name

# STORY:

it doesn't have an story, by autoexplain reasons
(its a survival game, it doesn't need a story)

# VERSIONS:

my idea is make this game have a LOT of alternative versions, being on my mind these versions:
